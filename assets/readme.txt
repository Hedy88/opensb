squareBracket assets

info:

# FOLDERS

profpic: profile pictures, dynamic. uploadable by users
backgrounds: channel backgrounds, dynamic, uploadable by partner-only users (requirement could be removed due to 2006L)
thumb: video thumbnails, dynamic, automatically generated, cannot be currently changed on the website (there was an instance of a squarebracket video having it's thumbnail changed, but that was done by using wget)

any static assets should ethier be on the assets folder, or if it's for sbnext, on the sbnext folder.

# BRANDING

the logo is made with illustator, when exporting the logo, some touch ups are required to remove the white background.

# ICONS (now on root directory due to some technical issues)

all of the iOS/Android/Win8 related icons (if someone wants to add squareBracket onto their home screen for god knows what) are generated using https://realfavicongenerator.net/.
Do not use the safari-pinned-tab.svg as a replacement for a png, it's a poorly converted svg meant for the 0.01% chance that someone uses squareBracket on a macbook with touch bar.
