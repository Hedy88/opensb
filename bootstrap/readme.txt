squareBracket Bootstrap Theme

Our custom Bootstrap theme for squareBracket. Originally in the Milestone 1 days it was some Bootstrap 3 edit, but we updated to Bootstrap 5 in May 2021.

Colors are a bit inconsistent, since some shades of gray have a "blue"-ish tint, which looks a bit dull, yet most of the colors are vibrant.

Dark theme looks decent but is a bit unpolished.

The Dashboard and Signin css files are from the Bootstrap documentation.

Compiling 5.0.2 is broken. https://github.com/scssphp/scssphp/issues/434
